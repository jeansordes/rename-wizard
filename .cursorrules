# Cursor Rules for Rename Wizard

# Development Guidelines
- Follow test-driven development
- Add logs during feature development
- Use console for initial debugging
- Remove development logs before release

# Implementation Order
1. Write tests first
2. Implement core functionality
3. Add console-based validation
4. Create UI components last

# Code Organization
- Keep files under 300 lines
- One class/component per file
- Group related functionality
- Use meaningful folders for related files (ui, utils, types, tests, core, etc.)
- Maximum function length (e.g., 20-30 lines)
- Maximum nesting depth (e.g., 3 levels)

# Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Document complex logic
- Keep documentation up-to-date in the docs/ folder
- Explain technical decisions inline
- Document performance implications

# Testing
- Write tests before implementation
- Cover edge cases
- Test performance with large datasets

# Communication
- Ask clarifying questions before coding
- Never assume unclear specifications
- Report progress through comments
- Highlight potential issues
- When proposing multiple actions, number them so that the user can select one

# Performance guidelines:
- Cache expensive operations
- Use debouncing for user input
- Lazy load components

# Code Style
- Type safety:
  - No 'any' types without justification
  - No 'as' casts
  - Use strict null checks
  - Define interfaces for data structures
