- Adopt a functionnal approach as much as possible in the project (rather than OOP) so that tests can be easier to code
- When coding tests for a function, don't try to instanciate App, but call the function you are trying to test directly
- When building the project, use "npm run build", not "npm run dev"
- Don't try to create commits on your own, let the user handle this
- Don't edit styles.css, it is a builded file, and it will be overwritten. You should update src/css files instead
